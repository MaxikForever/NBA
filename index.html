            <h3>01 Giannis Antetokounmpo</h3>
            <img src="https://www.nbcsports.com/sites/rsnunited/files/styles/gallery_slide/public/article/hero/Giannis_A_USATI.jpg" alt="Giannis">
           
            <p>Antetokounmpo reached the NBA mountaintop in 2021 by winning a championship and Finals MVP award.</p>    
                <br>
              <p>He wasn't able to repeat in 2022 with Milwaukee after Khris Middleton suffered a knee injury at the beginning of the playoffs. But after averaging 33.9 points, 14.7 rebounds and 7.1 assists in a seven-game series against the Celtics, Antetokounmpo reminded us that he's the league's alpha right now.</p>
            </div>
      

            <div class="player">
                <h3>02 Kevin Durant</h3>
                <img src="https://www.nbcsports.com/sites/rsnunited/files/styles/gallery_slide/public/slide/image/Durant_USATSI_17027917.jpg" alt="Durant">
                <p>Durant had a claim as the best player in the world at the end of the 2021 season after going toe-to-toe with Giannis while James Harden and Kyrie Irving were hurt. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Antetokounmpo has overtaken him now, however. Durant missed a bulk of 2021-22 with an injury and then the Nets flamed out in the first round following a turbulent regular season. Maybe with his new team, Durant will be able to reclaim his status as the best player in the world.</p>

                <div class="player">
                    <h3>03 Stephen Curry</h3>
                    <img src="https://www.nbcsports.com/sites/rsnunited/files/styles/gallery_slide/public/slide/image/Steph-Curry-USATSI_18549474.jpg" alt="Curry">
                    <p>You might have thought he was done, but Curry can still be the best player on a championship team. He secured his first Finals MVP award after carving up the best defense in basketball for six-straight games. </p>
                        <br>
                    <p>Curry is not done terrorizing opposing defenses with his legendary shooting stroke, and it's hard to see when he'll slow down at this point.</p>
